# Modules

### As we mentioned previously, Metasploit modules are prepared scripts with a specific purpose and corresponding functions that have already been developed and tested in the wild. The exploit category consists of so-called proof-of-concept (POCs) that can be used to exploit existing vulnerabilities in a largely automated manner. Many people often think that the failure of the exploit disproves the existence of the suspected vulnerability. However, this is only proof that the Metasploit exploit does not work and not that the vulnerability does not exist. This is because many exploits require customization according to the target hosts to make the exploit work. Therefore, automated tools such as the Metasploit framework should only be considered a support tool and not a substitute for our manual skills.
